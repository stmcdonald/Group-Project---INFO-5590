Introduction: Describe the motivation for the application. What is the user or customer need and why does it exist? What pains do your users currently experience? What are your target users like? (worth 5 points)

Statement of functionality: Describe the capabilities of your application. What features does it offer? What is the scope? What are the functional and nonfunctional requirements? Be as detailed as you can, though you do not need to produce a formal requirements document

Describe at least three use cases (examples)for your application, at a high level

Describe the look and feel of the application.You are encouraged to create multiple images to show different screens or functions of the application. You are also encouraged to augment your visual aids with written descriptions. Describe how each of the use cases would work in your application. If relevant, describe the application or information architecture and take care to mention required software or tools to develop the application. You can use a mockup or prototyping tool (like https://moqups.com/); a general drawing tool like Powerpoint, Omnigraffle, Keynote, or others. (worth 5 points) 

Statement on sustainability: Assess your application from the perspective of one of the strategic frameworks discussed in this class. What is the main value of the application from the perspective of the user or organization who would finance its development? Consider the costs to develop the application and the sources of funds for the application and how you would justify constructing this application to key stakeholders (e.g. library directors, government officials, the public, investors) (worth 5 points)
